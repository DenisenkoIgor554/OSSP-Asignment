BackBox Linux OS | Bezawit Dires


**Installation**

BackBox Linux is a security-focused operating system based on Ubuntu, designed for penetration testing and ethical hacking. To install it, users first download the BackBox ISO image from the official website. Next, they create a bootable USB drive using tools like Rufus or BalenaEtcher. After booting from the USB, users follow the graphical installation wizard to configure language, partitions, and user details. Once installed, BackBox provides a lightweight, efficient XFCE desktop environment with pre-installed security tools ready for use.

 **System Call**

 BackBox Linux, like other Linux distributions, relies on system calls to allow user-level programs to interact with the system kernel. System calls are essential for performing low-level tasks such as reading files, creating processes, and managing memory. In BackBox, security tools use these system calls to interact directly with system resources during penetration testing. Egs.include using the execve call to run programs or socket calls to manage network connections. These system calls ensure that BackBox tools can perform tasks with precision and efficiency at the kernel level.
